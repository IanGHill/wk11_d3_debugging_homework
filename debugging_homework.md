#####What is the purpose of a breakpoint?

To stop the code execution part way through a program so you can examine the values of the variables at that point and/or step through the program from that point onwards and view the path through the code and see how the values of variables change as you step through.

#####Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?

No - it stops execution immediately before that line

#####How do we debug the next line of code?

Step over

#####What does the step into command do?

Goes into a called method to step through that

#####What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?

Evaluate expression only evaluates a single line of code.
With code fragment you can have multiple lines of code and also declare & use temporary variables.
